      },
      {
        q: "How does Redding's climate affect exterior building materials?",
        a: "Redding regularly exceeds 110°F in summer, which accelerates wear on wood decks, vinyl siding, and paint. We recommend fiber cement siding and composite or PVC decking for North State heat resistance and long-term durability."

      {
        q: "What makes fire hardening different for forested mountain properties like Magalia?",
        a: "Forested areas like Magalia have dense tree cover that can carry fire close to homes, with steep terrain that accelerates fire spread. Ember intrusion protection, combustible material removal around the home, and non-combustible exterior surfaces are especially critical in these conditions."
      },
      {
        q: "Can you work on older homes in Magalia for fire hardening?",
        a: "Yes. Most of the fire hardening we do is on existing homes. Many older Magalia properties have standard louvered vents, wood decks, and combustible siding — all upgradeable in phases. We walk through the home with you, identify the highest-risk areas, and help you prioritize improvements."
