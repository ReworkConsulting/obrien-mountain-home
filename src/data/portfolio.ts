    challenge: 'An off-grid family cabin in the mountains outside Red Bluff — the spot this family gathers at — needed its siding and decking replaced with materials that could stand up to fire risk and years of hard use.',
    solution: 'Re-clad the cabin in James Hardie lap siding and Hardie trim, rebuilt the front deck in TimberTech PRIME composite, and upgraded the vents to fire-rated Vulcan Vents — a finished cabin that is both beautiful and fire-safe for years of family get-togethers.',

      challenge: 'This family cabin sits off-grid in the mountains outside Red Bluff, and it has been the spot the family gathers at for years. The siding and the front deck had both reached the end of their service life. Being off-grid and surrounded by timber, the owners were not looking for a quick cosmetic fix — they wanted materials that would hold up to real fire risk and to decades of family use, on a property where help is a long way off if a fire ever comes through.',
      solution: 'We replaced the exterior with James Hardie lap siding and James Hardie trim, giving the cabin a noncombustible shell that will not feed a fire the way old wood siding does. The front deck was rebuilt in TimberTech PRIME composite decking — no rot, no annual staining, and far better behaviour under ember exposure than bare wood. While we were on site we also upgraded the vents to fire-rated Vulcan Vents, closing off the openings embers use to get inside a structure. Together those three pieces cover the cabin\'s most vulnerable surfaces: the walls, the deck, and the openings.',
      result: 'The family now has a finished cabin that is both beautiful and genuinely fire-safe — a place they can keep using for get-togethers for years, without the maintenance cycle the old siding and decking demanded and without the worry that came with it.'

      challenge: 'This was a straight fire-protection job on a vacation home at Lake Almanor, in a recognised wildfire risk zone. A house that sits empty for stretches of the year is exposed in a particular way — nobody is there to clear debris or notice a problem building. Two of the most commonly overlooked weak points on any home were doing exactly that here: gutters filling with needles and leaves, and foundation vents standing open to whatever the wind carries.',
      solution: 'We installed heavy-duty gutter protection so the gutters stop collecting the debris that clogs them and causes water problems down the line — and, more importantly in this location, so windblown embers cannot settle into a gutter full of dry fuel against the roofline. We then retrofitted all of the foundation vents to be fire-safe, installing Vulcan Vents from within. Vulcan Vents seal under heat, which shuts off the path embers use to get underneath a house and start a fire where no one would see it.',
      result: 'The home is now protected at the two points that most often let a wildfire in, in an area where that protection genuinely matters. The owners were very happy with the work, and they have real peace of mind about a property they cannot watch year-round.'

      solution: 'We rebuilt the deck with Trex Enhance composite deck boards and Fortress steel railing. Trex Enhance gives him a surface that will not rot, splinter, or need staining every season, and the Fortress steel railing is a clean, strong finish that stands up to North State sun far better than wood. It is a straightforward build done properly — the right materials, correctly installed, with the details handled.',
      result: 'He was very happy with the price and, more than that, with the peace of mind of having it done once and for all by a professional he could trust. No annual upkeep, no unfinished project sitting in the backyard, and a deck that will still look right in ten years.'

      solution: 'We upgraded all of their exterior vents to fire-rated units, and screened the front porch with wildfire defense mesh. That combination addresses the two ways embers were getting in on this house: through the vents into the structure itself, and into the porch, where they could settle among anything combustible and burn undisturbed against the house.',

Safety came first, and after that he wanted something genuinely high quality — not another deck he would be replacing in a decade.',
      solution: 'We rebuilt it on a steel frame structure from Fortress. Steel framing does not rot, warp, twist, or sag the way wood framing does, which matters on an elevated deck where the structure is doing real work. On top of that we installed new TimberTech PVC decking, and finished it with Fortress vertical cable railing. The cable railing was the right call for this house: it holds the line safely without putting a wall of pickets between him and the view he built the deck for.',

They called us to guide them through it.',
      solution: 'We walked the property with them and worked out what the standards required here. To meet them, we upgraded all of the exterior vents with Vulcan Vents, screened the underside of the deck with wildfire defense mesh so embers cannot collect and ignite beneath it, and added six inches of noncombustible cladding where it was needed at the base of the walls. Every piece of that targets the zone right around the structure, which is where a wildfire-prepared home is won or lost.',
      result: 'The customers successfully retained their insurance. Beyond that, they were genuinely pleased with how the work looked — the upgrades were done with real attention to detail rather than bolted on — and they came away with peace of mind about their wildfire risk on top of the coverage they were at risk of losing.'

On a job this size the contractor\'s real problem is not the siding itself, it is finding a crew that will show up with the numbers to do it and hit the date they have already promised. Once we opened up the exterior there was another layer to it: the building had extensive water damage that had to be dealt with before any new siding went on.',
      solution: 'We put 16 people on it, which is what a 35,000-square-foot exterior takes if it is going to land on schedule rather than drag. The crew carried out extensive repairs to the water-damaged areas first — there is no point cladding over compromised substrate — and then installed James Hardie siding with James Hardie trim across the property. Hardie was the right specification here: noncombustible, dimensionally stable, and low enough maintenance to make sense on a building an operator has to keep looking good for years without disrupting residents.',

Then we installed Trex Enhance decking with a contrasting picture frame border and wrap-around fascia.
