/**
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * NOT LEGAL ADVICE — HAVE AN ATTORNEY REVIEW BEFORE RELYING ON THIS.
 *
 * This replaces a ~180-word policy that did not describe what the site actually
 * does. The most important addition: form submissions are transmitted to
 * GoHighLevel, a third-party platform. The previous policy never disclosed that
 * personal information leaves the business at all.
 *
 * FOUR THINGS AN ATTORNEY SHOULD DECIDE
 *  1. Whether CCPA/CPRA thresholds apply. They attach above statutory limits
 *     (revenue, volume of consumers' personal information, or share of revenue
 *     from selling/sharing it). A contractor this size may fall below all of
 *     them. Section 8 is written to offer the rights without asserting that the
 *     business is a "business" as the statute defines it — safe either way, but
 *     an attorney may want it tightened or removed.
 *  2. RETENTION PERIODS. Marked "[X]" below. Only the business knows its actual
 *     practice, and publishing a period it does not follow is worse than
 *     publishing none. THESE MUST BE FILLED IN BEFORE THIS PAGE GOES LIVE.
 *  3. Whether to name GoHighLevel explicitly, as done here, or describe it by
 *     category only. Both are defensible; naming is more transparent.
 *  4. Whether anything here conflicts with California home improvement contract
 *     requirements, which live in the construction contract rather than here.
 *
 * KEEP IN STEP WITH THE SITE
 *  - Section 7 states there is no advertising/analytics tracking. That is true
 *    as of the date below. IF ANALYTICS OR AD PIXELS ARE EVER ADDED, THIS PAGE
 *    MUST BE UPDATED BEFORE THEY GO LIVE.
 *  - Section 4 lists GoHighLevel because that is where the forms post. If the
 *    webhook target changes, change this too.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
