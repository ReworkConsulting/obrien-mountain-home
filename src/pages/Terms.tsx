/**
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * NOT LEGAL ADVICE — HAVE AN ATTORNEY REVIEW BEFORE RELYING ON THIS.
 *
 * This replaces a ~154-word page. Section 4 is the most important addition: the
 * site publishes detailed articles about building codes, defensible space rules
 * and insurance discount programmes, several of which state specific figures and
 * deadlines. Section 4 disclaims that content as general information.
 *
 * FOUR THINGS AN ATTORNEY SHOULD DECIDE
 *  1. DISPUTE RESOLUTION. Section 13 sets venue in Shasta County and contains
 *     NO arbitration clause and NO class-action waiver. That is deliberate —
 *     both carry consumer-protection considerations in California that need
 *     real legal judgement. An attorney may want to add one.
 *  2. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Section 12 is drafted conservatively. California
 *     limits how far a business may disclaim liability, particularly to
 *     consumers, and unenforceable over-reach can invalidate a clause entirely.
 *  3. Whether the CSLB complaint disclosure in Section 3 is worded correctly
 *     for this business.
 *  4. HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACT RULES. California imposes specific requirements
 *     on residential home improvement contracts — written terms, down-payment
 *     limits, cancellation rights, mechanics lien disclosures. Those belong in
 *     the actual construction contract, NOT on this page. An attorney should
 *     confirm nothing here conflicts with them.

                <p>
                  The content on this website — including blog articles, guides, checklists and
                  service descriptions — is provided for <strong>general informational purposes only</strong>.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Building codes, defensible space and wildfire regulations</h3>
                <p>
                  We write about California building codes, wildland-urban interface (WUI)
                  requirements, defensible space rules and related regulations.{' '}
                  <strong>These change, and how they apply depends on your specific property, county and circumstances.</strong>{' '}
                  Nothing on this website is a determination that your property does or does not
                  comply with any law, code or standard. Always confirm current requirements with
                  your local building department, fire authority or CAL FIRE before making decisions.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Insurance information</h3>
                <p>
                  We write about insurance-related topics, including hardening measures that may
                  affect coverage or premiums.{' '}
                  <strong>We are contractors, not insurance advisers, brokers or agents.</strong>{' '}
                  We do not guarantee that any work will result in a discount, in coverage being
                  offered, or in coverage being retained. Insurance programmes, eligibility criteria
                  and discount amounts are set by insurers and regulators, change over time, and vary
                  by policy. Confirm anything insurance-related directly with your insurer or a
                  licensed broker before relying on it.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Wildfire risk</h3>
                <p>
                  No construction method, product or material eliminates wildfire risk. Fire
                  hardening measures are intended to <strong>reduce</strong> vulnerability. We
                  describe them honestly and we do not promise that a hardened structure will
                  survive a fire.
